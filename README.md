This Project is inspired from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe) curriculum.

## Things I learned

- Abstractions using Module Pattern and Factory functions
- Event driven approach to game loop (this took me sometime to figure out! But I'm proud of it now, yay ðŸŽ‰)

## Some things to do later on

- Refactor
- Replacing the randomly playing computer with an unbeatable AI
